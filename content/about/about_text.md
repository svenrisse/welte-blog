Well, I’m Noah Smith, and Noahpinion is my newsletter blog (meaning it’s
a regular column that you get in your email inbox, but which you can
also read on the web or in the Substack phone app. Noahpinion is mostly
about economics, but sometimes about other stuff like technology,
geopolitics, and culture. Basically, there’s a lot of interesting stuff
going on in the world, and I want to explain as much of it as I can. I
want to keep you informed, and if possible, entertained as well. And
because my training is in economics, I tend to come at things from an
econ angle.

Noahpinion puts out about 5 posts per week. In general, 3 of those posts
will be free for everyone, and 2 will be paywalled — that is, you have
to be a paid subscriber to read them. If you’d like to become a paid
subscriber, here’s a button that will let you do that:
